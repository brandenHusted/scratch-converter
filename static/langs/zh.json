  "easyTutorialSentence25": "To use PyStage you first need to make a scratch project",
  "easyTutorialSentence26": "and save it to your computer or copy your project link.",
  "easyVideoSentence" : "Here is a link to a video for beginners learning PyStage!",
  "easyTutorialSentence27": "Errors that can happen when generating",
  "easyTutorialSentence28": "Error in generating file!",
  "easyTutorialSentence29": "This means that the website could not load the content for your project.",

  "easyTutorialSentence31": "URL is incorrect or scratch is having server issues while you are generating your project.",
  "easyTutorialSentence32": "Unknown Error",
  "easyTutorialSentence33": "Most likely there is something not implemented yet that you used in your project.",
  "easyTutorialSentence34": "Keep in mind PyStage is in working development and not everything may work as intended yet.",
  "easyTutorialSentence35": "When your project is generated this box will show up explaining what PyStage has not implemented yet.",
  "easyTutorialSentence36": "Please go to",
  "easyTutorialSentence37": "if you have any issues to report with PyStage.",
  "easyTutorialSentence38": "Now that your project is converted into python the next step is to run your project with Visual Studio Code!",
  "easyTutorialSentence39": "If you do not have Visual Studio Code you can download it with this link ",
  "easyTutorialSentence40": "Download your code on our website.",
  "easyTutorialSentence41": "Take your zip file and unzip it by right-clicking the zip file and clicking",
  "extractHere": "extract here.",
  "easyTutorialSentence42": "Remember when you save your project on your computer what folder you put your project in.",

  "easyTutorialSentence47": "Your file path may be different to mine, here is an example of my filepath.",
  "easyTutorialSentence48": "Downloading Python",
  "easyTutorialSentence49": "If you have not downloaded python before open Visual Studio Code and on the left side of your screen you should see a tab that is called extensions.",
  "easyTutorialSentence50": "Click extensions and then type Python and download what you see in the picture below.",
  "easyTutorialSentence51": "Requirements to pip install before you begin",
  "easyTutorialSentence52": "Open the terminal and pip install the following commands.",
  "easyTutorialSentence53": "For example run pip install wheel and continue to run pip install for everything on the list below.",
  "easyTutorialSentence54": "Finally after setting up your enviroment you can open your python code.",
  "easyTutorialSentence55": "Right-click inside the Python file editor and select Run Python File in Terminal to run the code and it should look like this.",
  "easyTutorialSentence56": "You could also in the terminal type python pystagedog.py or whatever else you named your file.",

  "mediumTutorialSentence1": "This tutorial will take you through how to make a simple scratch game with a goal at the end!",
  "mediumTutorialSentence2": "There is one line of code missing in the image above from the game, can you guess what it is?",
  "mediumTutorialSentence3": "We will tell you the answer at the end of this tutorial.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence4": "For now lets go over each individual block of code and see what it does.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence5": "This block of code is executed when the green flag is clicked and it shows a message and resets the timer and score.",

  "mediumTutorialSentence9": "Click on variables and drag set your_score to 0 to the script area.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence10": "Now I challenge you to find the rest of the blocks on your own!",
  "mediumTutorialSentence11": "This block of code is executed when the d key is pressed when you move right in the game.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence12": "If you are touching the Cheesy Puffs then a message pops up saying Yum!",
  "mediumTutorialSentence13": "You score then changes by 1 as long as you are touching the Cheesy Puffs",
  "mediumTutorialSentence14": "See how many points you can get before it disappears!",
  "mediumTutorialSentence15": "This code changes x by 10 or -10 based on if a or d is pressed on your keyboard.",

  "mediumTutorialSentence21": "When d key is pressed ",
  "mediumTutorialSentence22": "if the Cheesy Puffs are touching the cat then we wait 1 second.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence23": "In this one second try and get as many points as you can!",
  "mediumTutorialSentence24": "Then the size is set to 0% although this does not make the Cheesy Puffs completely dissapear off the screen.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence25": "We set the x and y cordinates to -1000 so you can not see the Cheesy Puffs on the screen.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence26": "When you press the green flag the x and y cordinates are reset to their original position.",
  "mediumTutorialSentence27": "This is our project converted into Python.",

  "hardTutorialSentence23": "We say a message for 5 seconds and then say another message explaining the controls of the game.",
  "hardTutorialSentence24": "The message explaining the controls stops when the score is over 20 because we then say our hard mode message in the first code image above.",
